For running express server localling without needing to constantly restart the application
    nodemon (app.js)

Make an HTTP request from the terminal on a windows machine
    curl -method Post "http://localhost:8080/testing" 
    help curl

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"AccessToken":"123"}' -X GET localhost:8080/auth 
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"AccessToken":"123"}' -X GET localhost:8080

    Never ended up getting express to accept a JSON body???

Send a JSON payload in a CURL command
    curl -Body '{"AccessToken":""}' -Headers "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth
