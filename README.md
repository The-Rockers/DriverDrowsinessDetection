# DriverDrowsinessDetection
Python (keras) centered deep learning to detect driver drowsiness via trends in facial features (blink duration, etc)

## Updates
1. Dataflair Model + Exporting Models to Mobile

The primary thing to make sure that we can do is to get the models we train with keras / tensorflow to work with the mobile app we’ll be creating with react native. If we can’t deploy our models to those platforms, then no amount of training will have any utility. For this reason, I’m trying to get the model trained from the dataflair article up and running on my android device (samsung galaxy s6), just to learn how to do it.
